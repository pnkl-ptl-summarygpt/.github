# OFRAI
**Open Framework for Responsible AI**

Building open standards for AI agent governance, accountability, and responsible deployment.

---

## Our Mission

Make AI agent governance as fundamental as API documentation.

As AI agents move from experiments to production deployments—handling customer service, managing data, making decisions with real consequences—organizations need governance infrastructure.

OFRAI creates **open standards** that make agent deployment governable, auditable, and accountable.

---

## Current Standards

### **AACS - AI Agent Contract Standard** (v0.1)
A standardized format for documenting AI agent authority, responsibilities, and governance boundaries.

## Why Open Standards?

We believe agent governance should be:
- ✅ **Open** - Free for anyone to adopt
- ✅ **Collaborative** - Improved by the community  
- ✅ **Neutral** - Not controlled by any vendor
- ✅ **Practical** - Useful, not bureaucratic

Standards win through adoption, not mandate.
